# recipes-homecooking Group6

Our business "recipes-homecooking.com" is an online recipe website where anyone can search for new recipes 
and try them out. For each recipe there is a list of ingredients, estimated cooking time, difficulty level,
cooking instruction and sometimes link to a video where someone explains how to cook the recipe.
The first Website the guest sees is the Home Screen with some suggested recipes, links to top rated recipes,
link to the recipe inventory and a link to a webpage filled with some more video impressions for even more 
recipes.
